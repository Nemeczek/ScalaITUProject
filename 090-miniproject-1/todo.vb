Cheat sheet for Mini project 1 - Advanced Programming

Meet with Radek the following days:

Tuesday 05-04-2016
Sunday 10-04-2016
(prob. +1)


The project ---------

stream00/Stream.scala --> ????

stream01/Stream.scala --> contains example that violates property 1

stream02/Stream.scala --> contains example that violates property 2

To switch the file you are testing, uncomment a suitable import in
the top of the StreamSpecWasowski file.  Note, that if you comment
out all imports, you are testing the standard library's
implementation of Streams (which is not what we want to do).
